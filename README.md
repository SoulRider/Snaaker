# Snaaker147
Snake meets Snooker in this simple WinForms game.

This is a simple implementation of Snake crossed with the rules of Snooker.  It was developed so I could learn the basics of WinForms some years back.  

I recently discovered the source in an archive and thought I'd upload it here for anyone interested in some simple WinForms code.

Code includes resources file so game should run as per screenshots.  Project tested and saved in VS 2019 Community edition.
