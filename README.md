# Snaaker147
Snake meets Snooker in this simple WinForms game.

This is a simple implementation of Snake crossed with the rules of Snooker.  It was developed so I could learn the basics of WinForms a while ago.  

I recently discovered the source in an archive and thought I'd upload it here for anyone interested in some simple WinForms code.
